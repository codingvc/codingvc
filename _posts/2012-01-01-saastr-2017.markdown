## Further reading
This talk was based on two posts that I've written about de-risking:

* <a href="https://codingvc.com/startups-are-risk-bundles/" target="_blank">Startups are Risk Bundles</a> -- An explanation of the relationship between risks and startup valuations.
* <a href="https://codingvc.com/how-to-de-risk-a-startup/" target="_blank">How to De-Risk a Startup</a> -- A list of ways to remove risk from your startup in various categories like product/market fit or recruiting ability.

All of the risk-related posts that I've written can be found <a href="https://codingvc.com/tag/de-risking" target="_blank">here</a>.
